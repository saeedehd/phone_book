Code Challenge Front End
=======================

This is a code challenge for candidates applying to a position as front end
developer at ALTEN.

The Task
---------

In the attached folder you will find a simple web app for displaying a contact list.
It is possible to see a detailed view for each contact and to mark that contact
as a favorite. There is also a search function and functionality for filtering the
list to only display favorites.

1. The current version contains several examples of problematic code. The first
part of this challenge is to refactor and improve the code in order to show your
skills in different areas of front end developmend, such as markup,
JavaScript and styling. Feel free to make far reaching changes to all parts of
the code, including using a framework. However, be prepared to argue for your
choices and tell us how you reasoned.

2. The second part of the challenge is to change the look of the web app so that
it matches the _mobile first_-design represented in the images at the end of this
document. It is not necessary for the styling to be pixel perfect, but it is a
chance for you to demonstrate your competence in CSS.

We like consistent, scalable and modular code. Best practices and a good
accessibility is preferred.
Your web app should work in the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox.

Don't hesitate to ask us questions if there is something you are wondering about.

Good luck!
